Image Classification and Adversarial Attack Techniques
This repository provides a Python implementation for image classification and adversarial attack techniques using PyTorch. The code enables users to train a model on a specified dataset and apply adversarial attacks to assess its robustness.

Overview
The project focuses on the following core functionalities:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads images and labels, applies transformations, and creates data loaders.
Model Training: Defines the model architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG), trains the model, and saves it.
Adversarial Attack: Implements the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples and evaluates model performance.
Evaluation: Calculates accuracy and other metrics for both clean and adversarial images.
Dependencies
To run the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

torch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
Code Structure
The code is organized in a single Python script: image_classification_attack.py. It includes the following key functions:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loads image data and labels.
Applies transformations (e.g., normalization, resizing).
Creates data loaders for training and testing.
2. Model Training
Defines the model architecture.
Trains the model using a chosen optimizer and loss function.
Saves the trained model for later use.
3. Adversarial Attack
Implements the FGSM attack.
Generates adversarial examples by adding perturbations to input images.
Evaluates the model's performance on these adversarial examples.
4. Evaluation
Calculates accuracy and other relevant metrics for both clean and adversarial images.
Usage
Data Preparation
Create a directory to store your image dataset.
Organize the images into subdirectories based on their class labels.
Model Training
Modify the train_model function to specify the desired model architecture, hyperparameters, and training data.
Run the training script to train the model.
Adversarial Attack
Adjust the attack_model function to specify attack parameters (e.g., epsilon, attack type).
Execute the attack function to generate adversarial examples and evaluate the model's performance.

Example Usage
# Load the dataset
train_loader, test_loader = load_data(data_dir)

# Train the model
model = train_model(train_loader)

# Apply FGSM attack
adv_examples = fgsm_attack(model, test_loader, epsilon=0.1)

# Evaluate the model on clean and adversarial examples
clean_acc, adv_acc = evaluate_model(model, test_loader, adv_examples)
