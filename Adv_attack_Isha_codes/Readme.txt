Overview

This repository provides a Python implementation for image classification and adversarial attack techniques. 
The code leverages PyTorch and other relevant libraries to train a model on a given dataset and then applies adversarial attacks to test its robustness.

Dependencies

torch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn
Code Structure

The code is organized into a single Python script, image_classification_attack.py. It consists of the following key functions:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads image data and labels.
Applies data transformations (e.g., normalization, resizing).
Creates data loaders for training and testing.
Model Training:

Defines the model architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.).
Trains the model using a chosen optimizer and loss function.
Saves the trained model.
Adversarial Attack:

Implements the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack.
Generates adversarial examples by adding perturbations to input images.
Evaluates the model's performance on adversarial examples.
Evaluation:

Calculates accuracy and other relevant metrics for both clean and adversarial images.
Usage

Data Preparation:

Create a directory to store your image dataset.
Organize the images into subdirectories based on their class labels.
Model Training:

Modify the train_model function to specify the desired model architecture, hyperparameters, and training data.
Run the training script to train the model.
Adversarial Attack:

Modify the attack_model function to specify the attack parameters (e.g., epsilon, attack type).
Run the attack function to generate adversarial examples and evaluate the model's performance.
Example Usage

Python
# Load the dataset
train_loader, test_loader = load_data(data_dir)

# Train the model
model = train_model(train_loader)

# Apply FGSM attack
adv_examples = fgsm_attack(model, test_loader, epsilon=0.1)

# Evaluate the model on clean and adversarial examples
clean_acc, adv_acc = evaluate_model(model, test_loader, adv_examples)
